from collections import defaultdict, namedtuple

# collections.defaultdict() 
# generates name error - since we exclusively import defaultdict and namedtuple, we do not need the dot notation to access them and can directly use their names to call them as defaultdict()


# General sytax:
# from module_name import object_name
# import mutiple objects from a module syntax: 
# from module_name import first_object, second_object
# using aliases for object specific imports
# from random import randint as rint
